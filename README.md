## NAdens

`NAdens` is an R package containing functions for plotting data values and missing data frequencies together.

Plotting data frequencies and densities is handy for exploratory analysis, or just checking to see whether a data transformation worked as expected. This package provides functions to check the relative frequencies of missing data and the nonmissing data frequencies or density together.
